DESCRIPTION = """
Nuvola Player provides a tight Linux desktop integration for web-based media streaming services such as Spotify, YouTube Music,
Apple Music and others. The goal is to achieve more native user experience and tighter integration with Linux desktop
environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look like a native application as much as possible.

Features of Nuvola: desktop launchers, integration with media applets (e.g. in GNOME Shell and Ubuntu sound menu),
Unity launcher quick list actions, lyrics fetching, Last.fm audio scrobbler, tray icon, desktop notifications,
media keys binding, password manager, remote control over HTTP and more.
"""
